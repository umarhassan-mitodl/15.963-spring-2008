Does sustained performance exist? ({{% resource_link a6677c84-dec0-a525-b057-b1f4b38fbd47 "PDF" %}})

If hospitals were all "for profit", would the kinds of checklists described in Atul Gawande's article be more widely adopted?

Have you ever seen a managerial or organizational process that could be improved through the use of something like a checklist?

Why do you think Toyota is arguably still the most successful competitor in the automobile industry?

Can things like "checklists" or "the Toyota way" be a sustained source of competitive advantage? Why or why not?

Reviewing 15.900: Strategy fundamentals ({{% resource_link cf5f5428-da0f-e42f-7091-4fe8a92a864b "PDF" %}})
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


(Each student was asked to read one of the following cases: Rockwell International, Coke, Dell, Airborne Express, Husky, Mark Twain, Sun Power, Coors, and Nintendo.)

As you review your case, think about the following questions:  
\- What are the sources of competitive advantage for your firm?  
\- Are they largely structural or organizational?  
\- If they exist, identify the structural sources of advantage in detail. Do they stem from first mover advantage? From economies of scale or scope? From network effects?  
\- If they exist, identify the organizational sources of competitive advantage in detail. Can they be imitated? Why or why not?

Case: Best Buy and Circuit City
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Why was Circuit City initially so successful? How much of its success was driven by structural advantage and how much by organizational competencies? By other factors?

Why has Best Buy been so successful? How much of its success was driven by structural advantage and how much by organizational competencies? By other factors?

Why was Best Buy able to surpass Circuit City? Why did Circuit City not "simply copy" Best Buy's strategy?

Delta Air Lines (A): the low cost carrier threat, and Delta Air Lines (B): Song ({{% resource_link 17ad1b6c-8556-fe1e-1909-2611f7249879 "PDF" %}})
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Why has it historically been difficult for the established airlines to respond effectively to the challenges presented by low cost carriers?

Is Song well positioned, in your view, to challenge Southwest and other low cost competitors?

If you were running Song, what would you be worried about? What would be your top three priorities for action for the coming year?

Paul Levy and the Deaconess Hospital

{{< tdopen >}}


How would you describe the situation Levy inherited at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center? What challenges did he face? Why did previous turnaround efforts fail?

How did Levy get started in his new job? In particular, what were his objectives and what did he accomplish:  
\- prior to his first day at work?  
\- on his first day?  
\- during his first week?

What (if anything) was distinctive about the way Levy went about formulating, announcing, and implementing the recovery plan? What is your evaluation of his approach to staffing the task forces?

What is your prognosis going forward? What has Levy accomplished in his first two months, and what challenges remain? What is your evaluation of his management style? How should he proceed?

What are the challenges faced by Simmons in December 2001? How has Charlie Eitel's leadership affected the company in his first six months as CEO?

What should be the management team's top priorities heading into 2002?

What is Eitel attempting to accomplish with the Great Game of Life program? What is the premise of the GGOL program? How is it supposed to help Simmons or other companies?

Should Simmons roll out the GGOL program? If so, how, and how would you justify the $7.2 million investment to the New York investors? If not, why not, and what would you do instead? Be specific.
